Phase 3 Dev BootCamp project for @karyatis

As a new cook years ago I started keeping track of recipes that I wanted to try and ones that I liked. I would put tags on them. 
I have been using a Blogger blog for almost 10 years. I wanted to recreated it and put in some functionality that blogger didn’t have. 

As a user, I want to…
-Log in
-CRUD recipes
-Search for recipes
-Click to a new page to view additional recipes (pagination)
-Tag recipes
-Narrow recipes down by tags

Technical challenges:
-Write tests
-Deploy to Heroku
-AJAXify
